# PodChat
Podcasts are a popular way to share stories, knowledge, and discussions. 
However, they can be difficult for some people to fully enjoy. Young people, who are used to chatting online, might find it hard to engage with audio-only content. Additionally, understanding different accents can be challenging for many listeners. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, podcasts are often inaccessible.
To solve these problems, our project is developing a Python-based tool that translates 
podcast episodes into a chat format. This means that spoken content will be turned into
 text that looks like a conversation, making it easier to read and interact w

 

offering an immersive and interactive chat-based experience. Unlike traditional platforms such as Otter.ai and Rev.com, which focus exclusively on transcribing audio into text, or podcast summary tools that provide only passive content consumption.
Built with a robust tech stack that includes Python Flask for server-side development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive and responsive frontend, and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) for reliable database management, PodChat ensures a seamless and scalable platform. This combination of technologies allows for smooth integration and a user-friendly interface.
